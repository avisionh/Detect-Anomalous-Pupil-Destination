# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Schools Performance 2016-17
## Objective
The focus of this notebook/project is to investigate the use of **unsupervised anomaly detection** methods on **Schools Performance 2016-17** data. We are particularly interested in spotting anomalous pupil destination data. 

## Definitions
The following terms used in this project are defined below:
+ **Unsupervised data:** When your data is not labelled. *e.g. If you have income data but you do not know if this data is correct*
+ **Anomaly data:** Unusual and typically wrong observations/data points in your data.
+ **Unsupervised anomaly detection:** Spotting anomaly observations in your data without any labelled data to tell you whether your predictions are correct.

## Data
The data for this project comes from the [Schools Performance 2016-17](https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/). The data is here very rich and detailed. For the sake of demonstration and simplification., we will only consider a subset of this information
